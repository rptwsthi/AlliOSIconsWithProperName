AlliOSIconsWithProperName
=========================

This application is designed to create all icons required for any iOS application. This could have been created in better way usign mac os plateform I bet but something is better than nothing. :). So now the question is how it works? So before that to use this application you need to be a beginer iOS developer, who can find document directory of your applicaton on finder. Normally the path is, normally the path is, "/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/7.0".

Follow these steps:
 - Download and unzip application
 - run applicain using xcode
 - find document directory of your application
 - Paste you highest resolution icon(1024x1024) file in "Document" folder of your document directory
 - now re-run application using xcode or iOS simulator (in case of ios simulator you need to quit application and launch it again)
 - now see the folder you have all the icons ready to drag in your application (at XCODE) and use
